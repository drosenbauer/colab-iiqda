
Since 4.0.0 xx Dec 2017
- Moved to a feature rather than a plugin, to separate functionality for different products
- Fixed a bug where some rules were not exhibiting autocomplete/error highlighting
- Fixed a bug where an error in an Expect: comment would stop any imports working
- Added a configuration setting to open/not open imported files; useful when importing large numbers of objects at once
- Early access version of IdentityNow functionality; imports Sources, import/export transforms




Since 3.0.1 27 Feb 2017
- Fixed the log view not loading any more, and also now loads on Luna (again)


Since 3.0

- New wizard to build IdentityIQ Plugin projects 


Since 2.2 21 Jan 2016
- Problems with a quick-fix can be fixed from within the editor; position the cursor inside the error and hit CTRL-1
- The 'system' folder inside a project is no longer required. Any reference to external objects (e.g. standard IIQ objects)
  is now achieved by setting a project reference in your Eclipse project. Go to Project Properties->Project References
  and add it there
- Colons in object names are translated to underscores in filename during import
- Insert step in a workflow. Right-click on a <Step> declaration in a workflow, then click Source->Insert step. After giving
  a name, a new step will be created, that transitions to the step you clicked on. All the <Transition>s that went to the
  original step, will now go to the new step.
- Rename step in a workflow. Right-click on a <Step> declaration in a workflow, then click Refactor->Rename step. After giving
  a name, the step will be renamed. All the <Transition>s that go to the step will be updated.
- Custom compare filters. 'Compare with remote' now has custom filters to ignore differences that are due to the way Hibernate
  persists objects. id/created/modified attributes, quote mark differences, CDATA tags and entity references can now be
  filtered out of the list of differences.
- Outline view for Workflows. The Outline View in Eclipse will now show a more accurate model of a workflow when open in the
  main editor window, rather than just a generic XML view.
- Connection timeout in Project Properties page has changed from a slider to a text box, to allow larger timeouts to be entered
- Updated the 'most recently changed' tab for Import Artifact, so that the list of filtered types from the client is sent to
  the server. This allows us to limit the list of objects retrieved on the server side before we return a maximum number.
  Previously we would retrieve all objects, return a maximum number and then filter on the client side. This mean the list
  would often contain far fewer objects than it should. 
- Added ability to Hot Deploy classes. This will replace a class in the running Tomcat with the local version. Some caveats:
      - The class has to be loaded (i.e. it must have been used at least once in the running IIQ)
      - Inner classes are not supported (they will return a 'delete not implemented error'; this is a JVM limitation)
      - Tomcat must be started with the 'jpda' option
      - For existing projects, you can manually add
          debugTransport=dt_socket
          debugPort=<port, default is 8000>
        to the *.target.properties files
      - Then, simply right-click on the .java file, select the target, and the class will be replaced (until a restart of Tomcat)
- Updated Workflow-Import.xml for 7.0


Since 2.1 14 Jul 2015
- List of required JARs for a new project is now configurable (within the plugin - there is a file resources/requiredJars.txt)
- Fixed the ability to import workgroups
- Fixed an issue with UTF-8 import/export
- Added the ability to import setup.xml files (collections of <ImportAction> statements)
- Open Declaration (F3) will now go to the <Step> referenced in a <Transition> element, as well as already opening the file
  containing a <Reference> if it is in the current project
- Run Task context menu entry now shows a dialog with running status

Since 1.2 xxx
- Connection timeout (to IdentityIQ) is now configurable under Project->Properties->IdentityIQ Project Properties


Since 1.1 19 Jan 2015
- Double-click on log view entry pops up dialog with details
- Run Task option from context menu


Since 1.0 6 Jan 2015
- References now checked correctly in (afaik) all situations - any reference to an object. Rules are correctly included
  in compilation check
- Comment Style for expected variables:
  // Expect: <Class Name> <Variable Name>
  For situations like a workflow rule, where the rule expects certain workflow variables to be in existence. This works
  fine in IIQ but the compiler needs to know about the expectations. Also, FieldValue scripts where a Form will have a
  previous field available as a variable
- Make some things adjustable on a per project basis (right click on project->properties->IdentityIQ Project Properties)
  - Maximum number of lines you can have in a <Source>element before it is advised to use CDATA
  - Directories to exclude from searching for artifact files (e.g. build)
  - Some markers can be defined as Errors, Warnings, or ignored
- Fixed a lot of issues with correct location of markers/fixes on Windows (CRLF) format files
- Ignore 'ConnectorAfterCreate' rules. They are marked as beanshell but in fact contain PowerShell.
- QuickFix 'Surround with CDATA tags' can now be bulk applied


Since 0.9.4 19 November 2014
- Context menu now has 'Compare With Remote' for files - shows diff window
- F3 on <Reference> elements will now open the relevant artifact if it exists in the project
- HTTPS support. Will check known Root CAs first, then a project .keystore (if one exists). If there is
  still no valid cert, it will prompt the user to accept it or not. If accepting with 'always' it will
  persist the cert to a .keystore in the current project


Since 0.9.3 10 November 2014
- Converted Workflow-Importer CRLFs to LF
- Importer no longer converts LF to CRLF (fixes problem mislocations)
- Import wizard no longer shows if there is an error connecting to IdentityIQ
- New project wizard now cancelable for long-running "from remote" initialization
- Beanshell 'Convenience Syntax' now implemented for rule/script args
    This is where you can use identity.lastname instead of identity.getLastname()
- Refactor->Rename of artifact updates name inside file as well
- Refresh artifact imports same object again


Since 0.9.2 5 November 2014
- "void" error now ignored (i.e. if (void==someVariable))
- Workspace preferences now saved:
    Use SSB Template
    Auto surround <Source> with <![CDATA[
- Performance improvement - don't recompile all <Source> elements when one is flagged dirty

Since 0.9.1 15 October 2014
- Option on the New Project wizard to create SSB structure in new project
- Option on the Import wizard to automatically convert text in <Source> tags to <![CDATA[
- File selection tab on new project wizard now updates finish button correctly
- Fixed cursor position error after code complete.


Since 0.9.0 10 October 2014
- Temporary fix for error highlighting, so that we can distribute to the team. Need a more permanent fix.

Since 0.8.1 10 October 2014
- Application provisioning policy field scripts are now correctly checked
  - Standard FieldValue variables are passed in
- Rule Library errors are now flagged as such in relying scripts
- Fixed customization rule in applications incorrectly being applied to field script sources
- Deployment failure now raises a dialog box.
- Code completion v1 is now working. I'm sure there's plenty of work to be done on it!

Since 0.8.0 3 October 2014
- IIQ Rules can only be created in IIQ projects
  This follows the Eclipse paradigm of everything being available in the <Right Click>->New->Other menu; the wizard is responsible
    for telling the user it is the wrong type of project (try creating a java class in a non-Java project)
- Reconciler now working; This means that you get transient error/warning markers after keyboard inactivity (.5 sec). Problem
  markers (Window->Show View->Problems) now only updated on save. This is consistent with JDT functionality in Eclipse
- QuickFixes available for:
    Missing <![CDATA[
    Missing ]]>
    Missing Close XML Tag
    Consider Using CDATA Around Beanshell in <Source> tags
- Cosmetic (and not-so cosmetic) fixes for artifact import
    Removed 'standalone="no"' from <?xml?> declaration on import
    Added DOCTYPE back in
    CRLF after <?xml?> declaration.
    
Since 0.7.8 30 September 2014
- Handles Rules with methods
- Handles References to Rule Libraries

Since 0.7.7 23 September 2014
- On demand imports (e.g. import sailpoint.object.*) are flagged as warnings, but included in the compilation process
- Rule arguments are passed in as variables. This is taken from DefaultRuleArgs, which has to be crafted manually from the Rule Registry
- New Project Wizard creates a default reverse.target.properties file in the new project, with outline instructions
- reverse.target.properties is excluded from target environments for import/deploy artifact
- reverse substitution is working
